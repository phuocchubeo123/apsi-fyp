# Private Set Intersection from Bit Comparison

This repo includes my Final Year Project at Nanyang Technological University. The idea of this PSI protocol is based on [Private Computation On Set Intersection With Sublinear Communication](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1137).

This code is not fully releasable yet. I am actively updating the v2 branch, which contains the fastest version of this protocol.
